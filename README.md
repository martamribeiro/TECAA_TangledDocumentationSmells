# Introduction

In the realm of API documentation, ensuring clarity, conciseness, and usability is crucial for effective developer engagement and integration success. However, certain detrimental patterns, known as "documentation smells," can hinder these objectives. These smells are akin to code smells in software development, indicating potential problems in the documentation that may reduce its quality and usability. Among the most common API documentation smells are:

* Bloated Documentation Smell
* Excess Structural Information Smell
* Tangled Documentation Smell
* Fragmented Documentation Smell
* Lazy Documentation Smell

Identifying and addressing these documentation smells is vital for creating high-quality API documentation that is user-friendly and supportive of developers' needs. By avoiding these common pitfalls, API providers can enhance the overall user experience and foster better integration and adoption of their APIs.

This GitBook will focus and Tangled Documentation Smells and the potential of Large Language Models and Generative AI Tools in detecting, correcting, and improving those smells.
