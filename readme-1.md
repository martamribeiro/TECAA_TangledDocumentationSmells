# Tangled Documentation Smells Definition

## Definition

Tangled documentation smells refer to issues in software documentation that make it confusing, difficult to understand, or maintain. These "smells" are indicators of poor documentation practices, much like code smells in software development highlight problematic areas in the codebase.

1. **Inconsistent Terminology**: Using different terms for the same concept, which can confuse readers and make the documentation harder to follow.
2. **Outdated Information**: Documentation that is not regularly updated and contains obsolete information.
3. **Redundancy**: Repeating the same information in multiple places, which can lead to inconsistencies and increase maintenance effort.
4. **Poor Structure**: Lack of a clear, logical structure that makes it difficult for users to navigate and find the information they need.
5. **Incomplete Information**: Missing critical details, leaving users without the necessary information to understand or use the software effectively.
6. **Overly Complex Language**: Using unnecessarily complex language or jargon that makes the documentation hard to understand for the target audience.
7. **Lack of Examples**: Failing to provide practical examples or use cases that illustrate how to use the software.
